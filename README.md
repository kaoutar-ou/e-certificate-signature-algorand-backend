<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://e-certificate.vr4.ma/)
[![Product Name Screen Shot 2][product-screenshot-2]](https://e-certificate.vr4.ma/login)

Our project is a proof of concept for a digital certificate system using Algorand blockchain. The main goal of this project is to provide a secure and reliable way to issue and verify digital certificates. The project is composed of two parts: the website and the blockchain. The website is used to issue and verify certificates. The blockchain is used to store the certificates and to verify the authenticity of the certificates.And this solution is unique because of several reasons:
<br>

Here's why:

* We are trying to think outside the box by innovating a brand new E-Certificate solution, which will replace both automatic signature and traditional signature to introduce blockchain and web 3.0 in this product.

* We are trying to solve the problem of certificate forgery by using blockchain technology.

* In terms of performance and ease, adopting this solution will help university staff reduce the time spent signing and reviewing diplomas generated for thousands of students each year.

<br>
We are thriving to see the next generation of our major, IRISI for computer science and networking  to finish this piece of art with more
features and a better user experience. And why not witnessing some day our University  being the first to use this technology in the Kingdom of Morocco.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

In this section, we will explain how to setup the project locally.

### Prerequisites

You should have installed nodejs and npm on your machine. You can download them from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and
the versions used in this project are > 14.0 and > 8.0 respectively.
or yarn

* node

  ```sh
  node -v
  ```

* npm

  ```sh
  npm -v
  ```

* yarn

  ```sh
  yarn -v
  ```

The next thing to make sure you have is mysql or postgres installed in your machine . postgres v14 or mysql > 5

### Installation

_Below you will be instructed how to setup the project locally.Our project is divided into three parts_

* **Frontend**
* **Backend**
* **Local-server**

<br>

1. Create a folder locally named e-certificate-fstg
2. Clone the repo for frontend

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/abderox/e-certificate-signature-algorand
   ```

3. Install NPM packages (If you are facing issues with npm , use yarn)

   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

   or

    ```sh
    yarn install
    ```

4. Go to `utils/global-constants.js` and uncomment this line to work locally .

   ```js
   //const BASE_URL_API = "http://127.0.0.1:7000/api";
   const BASE_URL_API = "https://thawing-lake-25095.herokuapp.com/api";
   ```

5. Now clone the backend repository

    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/kaoutar-ou/e-certificate-signature-algorand-backend
    ```

    ```diff
    - Note : the branch named mysql contains the backend project , the branch renowned local-server , contains the code for retrieving the mac address from your laptop (We will explain that later)
    ```

6. Install NPM packages (ensure you are in the mysql branch)

    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

    or

      ```sh
      yarn install
      ```

7. Go to `config/db.js` and change the database credentials to your local database credentials.
8. copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change the database credentials to your local database credentials.
9. Go to `app.js` and change ```force:false``` to ```force:true``` 
    
    ```js
   sequelize.authenticate().then(() => {
        console.log('Connected to database');
        sequelize.sync({ force: true }).then(() => {
        console.log('Database synchronized');
        initial();
        }
        );
        }).catch((error) => {
        console.error('Unable to connect to the database', error);
        });
    ```
    ```diff
    ! Note : this step is important because it will create the tables in your database . Do it once and make sure the tables have been created in your database . After that change force:true to force:false.  
    - In order to avoid dropping the tables each time you run the project
    ```

10. Now switch to local-server (We prefer to open in a separate project , it should be running all the time )

```diff
+ Note : We prefer to use PM2 , so it could be running even after booting your laptop.
 
  
```

* If you are good with node command go ahead

```sh
    node index.js
```

* PM2 is a process manager for Node.js applications with a built-in load balancer. It allows you to keep applications alive forever, to reload them without downtime and to facilitate common system admin tasks.

* Check this :

    <https://pm2.keymetrics.io/>

    and this

    <https://www.tecmint.com/enable-pm2-to-auto-start-node-js-app/>

### Example Usage

<br>

* Install PM2

    ```sh
    npm install pm2 -g
    ```

* Start the local-server

    ```sh
    pm2 start index.js
    ```

* Check the logs

    ```sh
    pm2 logs
    ```

* Stop the local-server

    ```sh
    pm2 stop index.js
    ```

```
```
  
11. Database configuration

_If you are using MySQL_

* Run mysql server in your XAMPP or WOMP server
* Go to phpmyadmin
* Create a database named what you have have called it in the  `.env` file .

_If you are using Postgres_

* Go to pgadmin
* Create a database named what you have have called it in the  `.env` file .
  
12. Now you can run the project locally by running the following commands in three different terminals:

_Run node backend server_

```sh
    
    npm run start
     
```

_Run react frontend server_

```sh
    npm start
```

_Run local-server_

```sh
    pm2 start index.js or  node index.js
```

## Usage

If everything is working fine , you should be able to see the following page :

raw=true
width="500"
alt="Home Page"
/>
</p>

The first  time running the project , make sure your tables are created successfully.

```diff
! Note : This may not be the last version of our database , it is just to make things evident as clear as day. the screenshot below was taken from pgAdmin.
```

          - Just to make things clear and neat . Using the same menu component , we can specify for each actor (user with roles) , the authorized features and functionalities he is able to see and use . For example 🔽
  

      <br>

      _the super admin can create both admins and students so ⬇️_
          <img
            src="
            github/code2.png"
            raw=true
            width="500"
            alt="menu"
          />

      <br>

      _the admin can only create students ⬇️_
          <img
            src="
            github/code1.png"
            raw=true
            width="500"
            alt="menu"
          />

      
      * [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/routes-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://crates.io/crates/redant)
          - In this folder we have specified for each actor , the authorized paths he could access , depending on his roles.
          - This is easy to manipulate and modify , You need just to understand a bit the architecture we been following.
      * [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/store-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://crates.io/crates/redant)
          - In this project we have been manipulating the concept of centralized store for state management and we have chosen **_Redux_**
          - The ```actions.js``` file contains all the constants for the actions .
          - The files which end with ```***Action.js``` contains the logic of the action.js.
          - The files which end with ```***Reducer.js``` contains the logic of the reducer.
          - ```reducer.js``` combine all the reducers of the application
          - ```index.js``` for store creation .
      * [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/ui%20components-orange?style=for-the-badge)](https://crates.io/crates/redant)
        - contains the reusable components like loaders , accordions , cards ...
